                 A wildcard in the lineup of the Ubers, Barou Shouei serves as the main striker of the defensive based club.
                With his unpredictable dribbling and relentless attacks, he can cut through other team's defenses with ease.

                Rin Itoshi, the rising star emerging from Blue Lock, the little brother of the well-known Sae Itoshi.
               Just like his brother, Rin dominates the field with his raw talent that lies within his dribbles and curve shots
                making him a force to be reckoned with. Whenever playing against him, always get ready to put your LIFE ON THE LINE.

                Making an EXPLOSIVE entrance into the field, Shidou Ryusei is a striker no one has ever seen before. With his 
                unpredictable movements around the field, he leaves everybody dazed just trying to anticipate his next move.
                The way he can strike the ball into the goal with unpredictable moves are what sets him apart from normal strikers.

                Nagi is a young prodigy that is a master at controlling and trapping the ball. At instances
                Where average joes would think that the ball is beyond saving, Nagi will prove them wrong
                for his surprising touches and intercepts on the ball says otherwise.

                The pink panther, Hyoma Chigri, can blitz through the field with ease. Gifted with great legs for running,
                he brings the ball to distances far from the enemy's reach. He can turn the tides easily as he wishes, however,
                with the acl injury on his right knee from his younger years, he is a ticking time bomb that can explode at any moment.
                He continues to play every game like it is his last, as once he explodes, he can never return to soccer ever again.

                <td> <p>
                Float like a butterfly, and sting like a bee. Bachira's unreal dribbling is known to be one of the best,
                if not the best, in Blue Lock. Once with the ball, he moves gracefully with it, as if dancing, and dribbles past
                other players with ease. Dribbling however is not just his strong attribute as his passes and shooting are to be
                noticed as well. The monster in him is no longer there for he IS the monster.

                <td><p>
                The Genius of Adaptability, The Demon King, The All-Seeing. With many titles to his name, Isagi lives up to 
                what they say he is. His dribbling may not be the best, nor is his shooting, but his ability to see everything 
                in the field is what makes him Blue Lock's trump card. Any play that is happening in the field, he will find a way
                to counter it, or amplify its effectiveness. He doesn't score through brute force, but intuition, analyzation, and
                anticipation. Wherever the ball goes, he will be there, ALWAYS. Everyone else are playing checkers, he however, is playing
                chess.

                <p>
                The German superstar who rose from the slums, Kaiser, is known to have the fastest shots ever in the Neo Egoist League.
                He can generate powerful shots with such a short wind-up. His dribbling is not something to be ignored either,
                the paths he takes to slip past enemies with his off-ball movement is something to be given praise of. Unlike
                other players, interceptions and defense don't work on him effectively, even if he is knocked down, or ragdolled, 
                he will find a way to shoot that ball with that same terrifying power as when on ground.
