                The pink panther, Hyoma Chigri, can blitz through the field with ease. Gifted with great legs for running,
                he brings the ball to distances far from the enemy's reach. He can turn the tides easily as he wishes, however,
                with the acl injury on his right knee from his younger years, he is a ticking time bomb that can explode at any moment.
                He continues to play every game like it is his last, as once he explodes, he can never return to soccer ever again.

                Float like a butterfly, and sting like a bee. Bachira's unreal dribbling is known to be one of the best,
                if not the best, in Blue Lock. Once with the ball, he moves gracefully with it, as if dancing, and dribbles past
                other players with ease. Dribbling however is not just his strong attribute as his passes and shooting are to be
                noticed as well. The monster in him is no longer there for he IS the monster.

                The Genius of Adaptability, The Demon King, The All-Seeing. With many titles to his name, Isagi lives up to 
                what they say he is. His dribbling may not be the best, nor is his shooting, but his ability to see everything 
                in the field is what makes him Blue Lock's trump card. Any play that is happening in the field, he will find a way
                to counter it, or amplify its effectiveness. He doesn't score through brute force, but intuition, analyzation, and
                anticipation. Wherever the ball goes, he will be there, ALWAYS. Everyone else are playing checkers, he however, is playing
                chess.

                The German superstar who rose from the slums, Kaiser, is known to have the fastest shots ever in the Neo Egoist League.
                He can generate powerful shots with such a short wind-up. His dribbling is not something to be ignored either,
                the paths he takes to slip past enemies with his off-ball movement is something to be given praise of. Unlike
